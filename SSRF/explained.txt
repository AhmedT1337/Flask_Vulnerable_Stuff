try to exploit this vulnerability in this code and turn it into XSS, SSTI and RCE if you can ðŸ˜‰

the usage of the function render_template_string made this code vulnerable to SSTI, to make your flask code more secure use the function render_template instead

the mitigation :
- the best way to mitigate this code is to add a whitelist and test the input against it.
- mainly just to check the url if it can be allowed or not
