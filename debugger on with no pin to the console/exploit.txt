with the debug mode on and WERKZEUG_DEBUG_PIN set to off in the environment of the application
these conditions may lead into RCE as flask as well as django offers a "console" to execute python code
using the application server, which you can use to execute os commands or python code if you have access to it

navigate to /console in the application

use the code :

__import__('os').popen("<here goes the command").read();


in flask the latest version this vulnerability if fixed by default as the WERKZEUG_DEBUG_PIN variable in the env if set to 9 random digits PIN code, However you can still look for it in flask and django applications hoping to find it 😁😅
